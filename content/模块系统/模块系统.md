## Crates

- A _crate_ is the smallest amount of code that the Rust compiler considers at a time.
- Crates can contain modules, and the modules may be defined in other files that get compiled with the crate
- A crate can come in one of two forms: a binary crate or a library crate.
	- _Binary crates_ are programs you can compile to an executable that you can run, such as a command-line program or a server.
	- _Library crates_ don’t have a `main` function, and they don’t compile to an executable.Instead, they define functionality intended to be shared with multiple projects.

## Packages

A _package_ is a bundle of one or more crates that provides a set of functionality. A package contains a _Cargo.toml_ file that describes how to build those crates.
